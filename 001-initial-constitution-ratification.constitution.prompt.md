## Prompt

                                                      # Constitution Specification for Evolution of Todo - Phase I

## Adherence Checks (Non-Negotiable)
- Strictly follow this spec when generating CONSTITUTION.md. Reference all reusable skills (@scales/task-crud-skill.md, @scales/cli-parser-skill.md, etc.) for modularity.
- Do not neglect: Enforce PEP 8, type hints, error handling. Use subagents (e.g., @agents/domain-expert.md for logic review).
- Validate output: Constitution must govern every feature; add a "Governance" section repeating principles.

## Purpose
- Define the project's core goal: Build an in-memory Python console Todo app using spec-driven development, evolving to cloud-native AI. Emphasize shift to system architect role, integrating reusable intelligence for bonuses (+200 points).

## Principles (Repeat in Every Section to Prevent Neglect)
- Spec-Driven Only: No manual code; refine specs for Claude Code.
- Clean Code: PEP 8, type hints, modular classes (e.g., TodoManager using task-crud skill).
- Reusable Intelligence: Mandate use of subagents (domain-expert, reviewer) and skills for all operations.
- User Focus: Intuitive CLI with prompts; prep for Urdu support (+100 bonus).
- Error Handling: Validate all inputs via error-validation-skill.md; no crashes.

## Scope
- Limit to Basic Features: Add (title/desc), Delete (by ID), Update, View (with status), Mark Complete.
- Exclusions: No DB, web, advanced features; design modular for Phase II evolution.
- Tech: Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus. Reference WSL 2 for Windows.

## Governance (To Enforce Focus)
- All Claude generations must start with: "Adhering to Constitution Principles..."
- Use reviewer subagent to check for deviations (e.g., ignored skills).
- Bonus Integration: Include reusable intelligence from start for +200 points.

## Expected Output Format
- Markdown with exact sections above. Save as CONSTITUTION.md.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution for "Evolution of Todo - Phase I" project with the following structure:

**Core Principles** (6 principles):
1. Spec-Driven Development Only - All code via Claude Code specs, no manual coding
2. Clean Code Standards - PEP 8, type hints, docstrings, 88-char line limit
3. Reusable Intelligence Architecture - Mandatory use of 4 skills + 2 subagents for +200 bonus
4. User-Centric CLI Design - Intuitive UX, clear errors, Urdu-ready (+100 bonus prep)
5. Comprehensive Error Handling - Zero crashes via error-validation-skill
6. Test-Driven Development Discipline - Red-Green-Refactor when tests requested (optional)

**Reusable Intelligence Assets**:
- Task CRUD Skill: In-memory storage, CRUD operations, auto-increment IDs
- CLI Parser Skill: Parse commands to structured {'command': str, 'args': dict}
- Error Validation Skill: validate_task_id(), validate_title()
- Display Formatter Skill: Checkbox format [X]/[ ] with ID, title, description

**Scope Definition**:
- In Scope: 5 basic features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
- Out of Scope: Persistence, web/API, auth, advanced features (deferred Phase II+)
- Tech Stack: Python 3.13+, UV package manager, Claude Code, SDD-RI framework

**Development Workflow**:
- 7-step lifecycle: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Review → Document → Record
- Constitution Check gates before research and implementation
- Feature branches: ###-feature-name (e.g., 001-add-task)

**Governance**:
- Amendment procedure: Proposal → ADR → Approval → Migration → Version bump
- Versioning: Semantic (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Compliance: Every spec starts with "Adhering to Constitution Principles..."
- ADRs for 3-criteria decisions (Impact + Alternatives + Scope)
- PHRs mandatory after every user prompt (routed by stage)

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-31

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance for Evolution of Todo project - Phase I. All 6 principles defined with enforcement mechanisms. Reusable intelligence architecture documented for +200 bonus qualification. Constitution gates integrated into templates.
- 🧪 Tests: None (constitution is documentation artifact)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (371 lines), verified template placeholders fully replaced
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create first feature specification, followed by /sp.plan for architecture
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures all user requirements including skill references, subagent usage, bonus strategies, and governance enforcement. Sync Impact Report confirms template alignment. Ready for feature development.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - All placeholders resolved, no template remnants, version/date format validated
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check Gate alignment: PASS, Template consistency: PASS, Semantic completeness: PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): baseline-constitution-v1
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test constitution compliance by creating first feature spec with /sp.specify, verify "Adhering to Constitution Principles..." header enforcement and skill reference validation
