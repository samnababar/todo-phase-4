## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for ObsidianList landing page (002-landing-page branch).

**Specification Details**:
- **Feature Branch**: 002-landing-page (new branch created)
- **Spec File**: specs/002-landing-page/spec.md (297 lines)
- **Quality Checklist**: specs/002-landing-page/checklists/requirements.md (passes all checks)

**Content Coverage**:
- **5 User Stories** (prioritized P1-P3): First-time discovery, Feature exploration, Conversion action, Mobile experience, Brand validation
- **66 Functional Requirements** (FR-001 to FR-066) grouped by section:
  - Hero Section (9 requirements)
  - How It Works Section (8 requirements)
  - Call-to-Action Section (5 requirements)
  - Specs Image Section (7 requirements)
  - Footer (6 requirements)
  - Design System Compliance (11 requirements)
  - Responsive Design (7 requirements)
  - Performance (4 requirements)
  - Accessibility (6 requirements)
  - Content (3 requirements)
- **12 Success Criteria** with measurable metrics (load times, Lighthouse scores, CTR, accessibility compliance)
- **6 Edge Cases** (slow network, JS disabled, small screens, high contrast, missing images, large fonts)
- **8 Assumptions** documented
- **12 Out of Scope items** explicitly excluded

**Reusable Intelligence**:
- **Skills Referenced**: obsidian-theme-skill, landing-hero-skill, how-it-works-section-skill, cta-section-skill, specs-image-section-skill, footer-skill
- **Subagents Referenced**: landing-page-architect-subagent, frontend-dev-subagent, reviewer-subagent

**Design System Adherence**:
- Strict color palette: #000000 (black), #8B5CF6 (violet primary), #A78BFA (violet hover), #E0E0E0 (body text), #FFFFFF (headings), #4B5563 (muted)
- No green/red colors (violet-only for success/warnings)
- 300ms transitions with cubic-bezier easing
- Violet glow shadows on hover
- Mobile-first responsive design (320px+)

**Quality Validation**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria technology-agnostic and measurable
- ✅ No implementation details (framework-agnostic)
- ✅ Complete user scenarios with Given-When-Then acceptance criteria

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive landing page specification created, ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: None (specification phase)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (297 lines) and requirements.md checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to generate implementation plan for landing page
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec is extremely detailed with exact color codes, sizing, spacing, and interaction behaviors - this level of detail will enable precise implementation without ambiguity

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification process completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All quality checklist items validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with detailed visual requirements
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): During planning, validate that all 6 referenced skills have corresponding skill definition files in .claude/skills/
