## Prompt

Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment - Task Breakdown with 10 groups covering Docker containerization, Minikube setup, Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart creation, kubectl-ai integration, kagent integration, Gordon integration, end-to-end testing, documentation, and cleanup/submission prep.

## Response snapshot

Generated `specs/004-k8s-deployment/tasks.md` with 79 tasks across 8 phases:
- Phase 1: Setup (7 tasks) - prerequisite verification
- Phase 2: US1 Containerize (10 tasks) - Dockerfiles, docker-compose, image builds
- Phase 3: US2 K8s Deploy (16 tasks) - Minikube setup, manifests, deploy, verify
- Phase 4: US3 Zero Downtime (4 tasks) - rolling updates, graceful shutdown, rollback
- Phase 5: US4 Helm Chart (20 tasks) - chart structure, template conversion, install/upgrade
- Phase 6: US5 AIOps (8 tasks) - kubectl-ai, kagent, Gordon installation and testing
- Phase 7: US6 Documentation (3 tasks) - k8s/README.md, AIOPS.md, root README
- Phase 8: E2E Testing (11 tasks) - full verification, scaling, failure recovery, cleanup

Dependencies documented with critical path. Parallel opportunities identified. MVP = Phases 1-3.

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete task breakdown for Phase IV K8s deployment
- Tests: N/A (task list document)
- Files: specs/004-k8s-deployment/tasks.md
- Next prompts: Run /sp.implement to begin execution, or /sp.plan for architecture plan first
- Reflection: User provided detailed checklist that mapped well to user stories from spec
