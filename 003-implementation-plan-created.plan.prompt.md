## Prompt

Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment - Implementation Plan

OVERVIEW:
Deploy Phase III AI-Powered Todo Chatbot to local Kubernetes using Minikube, Helm charts, and AIOps tools (kubectl-ai, kagent, Gordon). Complete all requirements including Docker containerization, Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart creation, and AIOps integration.

ESTIMATED TIME: 40-50 hours
Recommend: 6-8 hours/day for 6-7 days OR intensive 10-12 hours/day for 4-5 days

EXECUTION STRATEGY:

STAGE 1: CONTAINERIZATION (Docker + Gordon) - 8-10 hours
STAGE 2: MINIKUBE & LOCAL K8S SETUP - 3-4 hours
STAGE 3: KUBERNETES MANIFESTS - 10-12 hours
STAGE 4: HELM CHART CREATION - 8-10 hours
STAGE 5: AIOPS INTEGRATION (kubectl-ai, kagent, Gordon) - 6-8 hours
STAGE 6: END-TO-END TESTING - 5-6 hours
STAGE 7: DOCUMENTATION & SUBMISSION - 4-5 hours

RISK MITIGATION: Docker image size, Minikube resources, AIOps tool availability, schedule pressure.
CONTINGENCY: Prioritize core K8s deployment, simplify replicas, cut optional AIOps features if needed.

## Response snapshot

Generated 5 Phase 1 artifacts for the `/sp.plan` workflow:

1. **plan.md** — Full implementation plan with technical context, constitution check (all PASS), 5 architecture decisions (AD-1: External Neon DB, AD-2: Raw manifests first then Helm, AD-3: LoadBalancer for frontend, AD-4: imagePullPolicy Never, AD-5: Secrets via CLI), 7 implementation stages with gates, and risk mitigation table.

2. **research.md** — 6 research decisions resolving all technical unknowns: R1 Docker multi-stage builds, R2 K8s health checks, R3 Helm values strategy, R4 Service exposure, R5 AIOps compatibility, R6 Frontend API URL configuration (SSR proxy pattern).

3. **data-model.md** — Kubernetes resource entity model: Namespace, ConfigMap, Secret, 2 Deployments, 2 Services. Helm values schema. Pod lifecycle state transitions. Resource relationships diagram.

4. **contracts/openapi.yaml** — Health endpoint contracts for K8s liveness/readiness probes (backend `/health`, frontend `/`).

5. **quickstart.md** — Step-by-step deployment guide: Minikube start, Docker env, build images, create secrets, deploy (raw or Helm), access, verify, AIOps.

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete Phase 1 planning artifacts for K8s deployment feature
- Tests: Constitution check 14/14 PASS, spec checklist 16/16 PASS
- Files: 5 files created (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml, quickstart.md)
- Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to begin execution of tasks.md
- Reflection: User provided comprehensive plan input; mapped 7 stages to architecture decisions and research items

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell scripts resolve wrong directory; worked around with manual file creation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution gate PASS, spec quality PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Run agent context update script when available
