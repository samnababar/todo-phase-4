## Prompt

Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment - Complete Feature Specifications covering Docker containerization (multi-stage builds for frontend and backend), Kubernetes manifests (namespace, configmap, secrets, deployments, services, ingress), Helm chart structure, Minikube setup, kubectl-ai integration, kagent integration, Docker AI (Gordon) integration, deployment workflow, health checks and monitoring, troubleshooting guide, testing checklist, and documentation requirements.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification at `specs/004-k8s-deployment/spec.md` with:
- 6 user stories (P1: containerization + K8s deployment, P2: zero downtime + Helm, P3: AIOps + docs)
- 23 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-023)
- 10 measurable success criteria
- 5 edge cases identified
- Clear scope boundaries (in/out)
- Dependencies, assumptions, and risks documented
- Quality checklist at `specs/004-k8s-deployment/checklists/requirements.md` - all items PASS
- No clarifications needed; user input was comprehensive

## Outcome

- Impact: Feature specification complete and validated for Phase IV K8s deployment
- Tests: Specification quality checklist - 16/16 items PASS
- Files: specs/004-k8s-deployment/spec.md, specs/004-k8s-deployment/checklists/requirements.md
- Next prompts: Run /sp.plan to create implementation plan, then /sp.tasks
- Reflection: User provided exceptionally detailed input including exact manifests; spec abstracts to business-level requirements while preserving all detail for plan phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist PASS (16/16)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
